	<p>The Valiant Database aims to be the ultimate resource for covers and issue information on all Valiant titles since <%= link_to "Valiant Entertainment", "http://www.valiantuniverse.com" %> launched in 2012. We also have information on classic Valiant titles from 1991-1996 and will be adding Acclaim books in the near future. This site is brought to you courtesy of <%= link_to "Valiant Central", "http://valiantcentral.com" %>, your daily source of everything Valiant on the web. Special thanks to Benjamin Szink and Greg Holland, and Jonathan Sanchez for helping locate covers, and Rob Mullin for helping enter information.</p>

	<h3>User Accounts</h3>
	<p>Registering an account is simple. Simply click on the <%= link_to "Register", new_user_registration_path, :title => "Register an account", class: "label label-default" %> button on the home page to start, or click on the <%= link_to "Sign up", new_user_registration_path, :title => "Register an account", class: "label label-default" %> in the <%= link_to "Sign In", new_user_registration_path, :title => "Register an account", class: "label label-default" %> page to begin. All fields are required but you just need to provide your name, email address, and a password to get started. Passwords are cryptographically scrambled so we have no access to them.</p>
	<p>If you have registered an account, click sign in and enter your credentials. You will notice the sign in page also has links to <%= link_to "Sign in with Facebook", user_omniauth_authorize_path(:facebook), class: "label label-primary" %> or <%= link_to "Sign in with Google+", user_omniauth_authorize_path(:google_oauth2), class: "label label-danger" %> If you don't wish to create a new account, you can sign in with these links. If you already have an account, you can connect your Facebook or Google accounts with your existing registration as long as the email address is the same.</p>
	<p>If you lose your password, go to the sign in page and click on <span class="label label-default">Forgot your password?</span> and enter your email address. You will receive an email with a link to enter a new password.</p>
	<p>If you want to cancel your account, look on the menubar for your name, click on it, then select <span class="label label-default">Edit profile</span>. Towards the bottom of the page, you will see a <span class="label label-default">Cancel my account</span> section with a link to cancel your account. Please remember that if you have items in your collection or wishlist. Those items will be deleted once you cancel your account, so if you wish to come back, you will have to start those lists over.</p>
